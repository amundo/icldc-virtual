Here is a step-by-step guide for publishing an academic resume on GitHub Pages using Visual Studio Code:

1. Create a GitHub account: Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com) and sign up for a new account by providing your email address, username, and password.
2. Create a new repository: Once you have logged in, click the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository." Give your repository a name (e.g. "academic-resume") and select "Public" as the visibility.
3. Create a new file in your repository: In the repository, click the "Create new file" button. Call this file "index.html" and paste in the HTML code for your resume. You can find templates online or create your own.
4. Install Visual Studio Code: Go to the Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com) and download and install the software on your computer.
5. Clone the repository to your computer: In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and type "Git: Clone." Enter the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g. "https://github.com/username/academic-resume.git") and select a local folder to store the files.
6. Edit your resume: In Visual Studio Code, open the folder where you cloned the repository and make any necessary changes to your resume.
7. Commit and push your changes: In Visual Studio Code, use the Source Control panel (View > Source Control or press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + G) to stage and commit your changes. Then, use the Command Palette to run "Git: Push" and push your changes to the GitHub repository.
8. Enable GitHub Pages: In your GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Select "Master" as the source and click the "Save" button. After a few moments, you will see a message indicating that your site is published and providing a URL where you can view it.

Your academic resume should now be accessible to anyone via the URL provided by GitHub Pages.
